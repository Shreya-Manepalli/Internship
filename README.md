ABSTRACT

GKN Aerospace generates a substantial volume of unstructured data annually, comprising reports,
documents, and images. This internship aimed to leverage data mining techniques to extract valuable
information from this vast repository of PDFs, word files, and images enabling the creation of insightful
datasets for data analysis using Python. This work encompasses three distinct projects. In the first
project, I extracted specific data from Non-Conformance Reports (NCRs) and organized it into an Excel
file. This curated dataset can now be used for data analytics. The second project involved extracting
color codes from images of airplane wings and systematically storing them in a structured database. The
third project revolved around generalized data mining from PDF and Word documents. These extraction
algorithms are designed to efficiently capture various data elements, including tables, equations,
relevant text, figure/table captions, and data from images. The Python codes developed can be adopted
for similar usage with minimum changes.
